# IJC437 Project Repository

This repository contains the R code for my IJC437 applied data science project.
The project analyses daily PM2.5 concentrations in London and explores whether
meteorological conditions are associated with high pollution days.

## Data
- PM2.5 data: OpenAQ API (v3), four London monitoring stations
- Weather data: Open-Meteo Archive API
- Study period: January to July 2025

## How to run

The analysis was carried out in R.  
The main steps of the analysis are implemented in R scripts located in the `code` folder.

To reproduce the analysis, open the scripts in order and run them sequentially in R or RStudio.
